Design Notes 

Python does not have abstract base classes until Python 2.6. SIFT is built around the use of abstract base classes to polimorphicy implement pattern matching functions and state functions.

SiftEngine   -- An abstract base class to find complex patterns in "text" and hold state about the "text".
SiftState    -- A base class which is used to hold state (good, bad, ugly or Green, Amber, Red) about an entity.
SiftRegEx    -- A regex wrapper class to make finding lines of matching text as well as providing common patterns.
SiftData     -- A base class designed to hold data gleened from SiftRegEx 
SiftStream   -- A base class to handle data movement from files or network.
SiftAlert    -- An abstract base class to define an interface to an alerting system such as Nagios or other monitoring system.

The design will be:
SiftEngine inherits:
    SiftState
    SiftRegEx
    SiftData
