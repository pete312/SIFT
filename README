SIFT is an open source block parser. It's useful in probing a stream for 
sequences or blocks of data in order to automate, monitor or report status
based on content. It is possible to create complex interdependant block parsers.
A demo is in the bin directory called sift.py

It's design is intended to be used by support personel who are fimilar 
with the basics of python programming, but simple enough that a new parser 
should be easy enough to create in 30 minutes. The design should also make 
multiple custom log parsers easy to manage.
